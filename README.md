# HAVEN - Hawaii Advanced Visualization Environment Nexus

May 28th, 2017  
Laboratory for Advanced Visualizations and Applications at the University of Hawaii at Manoa  

## About  
The analysis and understanding of outputs from energy planning models is often difficult. This is especially true when explaining the impacts of complex, integrated data sets to stakeholders and policy makers who may not be well-versed in the data and models used in the analyses. Communication is critical to ensure these stakeholders have a clear understanding of the potential impact planning decisions will have on Hawaiiâ€™s energy landscape.

The goal of the Hawaii Advanced Visualization Environment Nexus (HAVEN) is to demonstrate visualization as a means of analyzing and communicating the tradeoffs and inter-dependencies of resource deployment to achieve a 100% RPS for Hawaii's electric sector
